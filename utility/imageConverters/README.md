`imageWahing.py` is basically reading the images in the same folder, but only the pixel info. Then copy them into a new folder with nothing but pixel colors.

I created it to fixed some images with weird meta info. 

`webpToPng.py` is easy, convverting `.webp` to `.png`. 

`osuCarmen.css` is the style sheet that ~~overdrive~~ overwrites the Carmen Canvas website and gives it a **Dark Theme**.
